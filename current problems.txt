Problem: Supplied unit tests not running.
Solution: JAVA_HOME was set to Java 17, not Java 8. Unit tests now are able to be run.

Potential Problem:
Employee GET implies that direct reports only stores the employeeID for directReports.
	This is further backed up by the database JSON file.
My code currently runs off the assumption that those are full employee objects in direct Report, as is implied by the code structure of the Employee object.

This may need to be rectified by the ReportingStructure object making a GET call on the employeeIDs of the employees in the direct reports, so that we can access the full information of those employees.
	Is there a better way to do this without too much entanglement?

Potential Problem:
ReportingStructure and Compensation require GET with employeeID.
	Neither object stores employeeID.
Is creating a getEmployeeID method in them sufficient enough for Spring to recognize and use that, even though the objects themselves are not storing the employeeID of the employee they are for?

If it isn't, then what can be done to get around this issue?
