Problem: Supplied unit tests not running.
Solution: JAVA_HOME was set to Java 17, not Java 8. Project structure was trying to use Java 11. Unit tests now are able to be run with both being set to Java 8.

Problem: SSL message doesn't go through when trying to GET an employee for the test ReportingStructure.
	Could just make the employee object myself, but that is not exactly very condusive to the fact that the database has everything I need.
Solution: Was trying to do an https call instead of an http call. Fixing this fixed the issue with SSL.

Potential Problem:
Employee GET implies that direct reports only stores the employeeID for directReports.
	This is further backed up by the database JSON file.
		My code currently runs off the assumption that those are full employee objects in direct Report, as is implied by the code structure of the Employee object.
Problem:
NullPointerException when calling getDirectReports.
	This is most certainly a result of the above potential problem recognized, where the Employee IDs are currently the only things stored by the direct reports array, despite the
	structure implying that a full Employee object would be filling that location.
		I see two potential fixes to this: Fix 1 is to make it so that when the database is being read, the direct reports for an employee is checked, and if it has nulls,
		we query the database to fill in the missing information. Fix 2 is to return what employee IDs we get back if the other information we need is null. Then, we query
		the database to get the info we need later on as we see fit.

This may need to be rectified by the ReportingStructure object making a GET call on the employeeIDs of the employees in the direct reports, so that we can access the full
information of those employees.
	Is there a better way to do this without too much entanglement?

What do we have for the problem above?
	We have an employee fully filled out, save for the direct reports, which only have employee IDs in them, everything else is null.
	We need to figure out how to fill out those nulls, or find a way to get the code to work without directly impacting those nulls.
		Perhaps what needs to happen is in the REST call, when we create the reporting structure, we then recursively fill in the rest of the details as necessary.
		This would ensure a fully filled out directReport structure upon creation, instead of the partially filled out one we get from a GET employee.

ReportingStructure REST endpoint is not persisted, it's recalculated everytime we call it.
	This could mean that it isn't stored in a database, and if so, perhaps the trick is NOT to build a Create and Read like Employee,but instead make a Read that repeatedly calls upon
	Employee reads to build it up before checking the final numberOfReports value and returning it.

Potential Problem:
ReportingStructure and Compensation require GET with employeeID.
	Neither object stores employeeID.
		Is creating a getEmployeeID method in them sufficient enough for Spring to recognize and use that, even though the objects themselves are not storing the employeeID
		of the employee they are for?
			If it isn't, then what can be done to get around this issue?

ReportingStructureServiceImpl
	We KNOW that fillInMissingDirectReportingData is working. However, we still get a null pointer exception when reading from Controller.
		is it because controller is still trying to reference a ReportingStructureService? Or is it bad method design for updateNumberOfReports?

All ReportingStructure issues are fixed: updateNumberOfReports was replaced by tallyReports, which uses a recursive system to calculate the amount of reports, and the rest of the
ReportingStructure items are now not database dependent, in line with what was stated in the README file.

For Compensation, how do we persist it and query it from persistence layer?
	Understanding this should open up how to format the REST calls for create and read

Problem: IllegalStateException when calling tests.
	Why are we getting this error? The code is not that different than what we have in ReportingStructure nor is it different than what we have in Employee as well.
	Seems we may be having a moment where a method is called when it shouldn't be. What could potentially be causing this?
	Neither Create nor Read are responsible for the error. Is it being caused by something in setup? Or is it being caused by us calling in a testEmployee using REST?
		Not when we call employee either. Is it possible that us just calling testCreateRead is the problem? If so, why?

Above solved after rebuilding the project and making sure that multiple instances of bootRun were not operating at the same time.

Problem: Reading a compensation is returning empty.
	Is the issue with the employeeID? We know we created it just fine, perhaps the issue is that we aren't getting things correctly?

Currently, Compensation stores an Employee Object to represent the employee. However, it would make more sense to only store what we need to identify the employee.
	Unlike ReportingStructure, which also needed an employee's direct reports, we only need the employeeID to represent the employee.
		Using employeeID instead of a full Employee object might be better and cause less issues in the long run.

Tests now passing! GetMapping in CompensationController was "/compensation/{employeeID}". Changed this to "/compensation/{employeeId}" which has fixed the issues with the read not being
able to find the comensation we were creating and sending to the database.
	I may try to look back on this, seeif I can get my intial method using EMployee Objects instead of just EmployeeID. To work. If it does, I'll go back to that.
